# Bowling-Mini-Project
Game Physics Mini Project 2019

We are using - Unity version: 2018.1.6f1

Move with W, A, S, D.
You can jump with SPACE.

There are a couple of options:
1. Change ball mass (it is in kg)
2. Change ball speed magnitude (velocity)
3. Change ball jump impulse
4. Change the bounciness after landing a jump. (Coefficient should be between 0 and 1)
5. Hit velocity impulse (streching - Hooke's Law)

The pin lanes are 0.5kg, 1.5kg (standard) and 10kg.
The last lane of pins has the streching effect when the ball collides with them. 

To run the porject just use the build .exe file in the folder "../Release/Mini-project.exe". 
To exit the program you have to ALT+F4.
